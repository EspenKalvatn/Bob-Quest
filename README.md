# INF112 - Platform Game
The 2022 semester assignment in the course INF112 - Introduction to Systems Development at the University of Bergen (UiB).

## Project Description
This project is a 2D platform game, where players can move around, collect items and interact/take damage with other objects. 
The game has multiple levels, and you can move on to next level ones you have completed the current level. 
The game supports local multiplayer on the same computer.
The project is based on a given [Maven template](https://git.app.uib.no/inf112/22v/inf112.22v.libgdx-template.git). 
We use the game engine [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) for this project.

## Requirements
An IDE running on either Windows or Linux (MacOS probably works, but not tested). You can for example use one of the IDEs [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/).
The computer must be able to run the game at 60 FPS (the game will feel slow if not).

## Build Instructions

### Setup
1. To run this project, you will need to install [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (version 17 recommended. We cannot assure that older versions work).
2. Clone the project from [here](https://git.app.uib.no/grabbane/inf112.22v.libgdx-template.git).

### Running
#### Note: The stable version of the project is on the `master` branch.
1. Locate the file "src/main/java/launcher/DesktopLauncher.java".
2. Run DesktopLauncher to start the game.
3. Use "WASD", "Arrow keys" and "IJKL" to control the different players.

## Known Bugs
Known bugs in the game can be found [here](src/main/resources/BugReplication.md).
